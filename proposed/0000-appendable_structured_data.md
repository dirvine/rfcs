# Summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used.

# Drawbacks

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

What parts of the design are still to be done?
